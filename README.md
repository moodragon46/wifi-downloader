# Wifi Downloader

Many times people have asked me to give them a file via usb, when there is a much faster and easier way. Temporarily opening up a simple webserver to transfer files can be a simple but insecure way to transfer files to another computer.
The reason it is insecure is that anyone on your wifi network can access your files, so do not use this on public wifi networks.

## How it works:

1. Use the app to open up a webserver with a specified file or folder.
2. Someone else on your network uses your ip address and port to access this webpage with a web browser. This webpage will download the file.
